1. "ls" only shows file and directory names, where as "ls -l" shows file
   and directory names along with other information
   (file sizes, owner name, group name, etc.)

2. -a: Shows all files, including hidden files
   -G: Don't show group names in long listing (used by -lG)
   -h: Show human readable format in long listing (used by -lh)
   -o: Same as -lG; shows long listing without group names
   -m: Fills width with comma separated list of files/directories

3. An absolute pathname is the entire path of the file
   "/home/ian.cowan/CSC270/lab01a.txt" whereas a relative pathname is relative
   to the directory you are currently located in (if I'm in /home/ian.cowan
   I can type "less CSC270/lab01a.txt" to view the file)

4. "cd .."

5. Underscores are better for naming files

6. You can use "which" to locate the location of the python binary interpreter
   "which python" outputs "/usr/bin/python"

7. "less" allows you to view text files

8. Exit less by pressing "q"

9. Square brackets denote optional items. "|" denotes mutually exclusive items

10. "ls *.py"; this process is called using a wildcard

11. You would use output redirection. The command would be "du > du.txt"
    - ">>" can also be used to append to a file rather than overwrite the file

12. "kill" will forcefully stop a process from running

13. Pipelines are when you connect two commands together using "|", that is
    taking the output of the first command and using it as the input of
    the second command and running them one after another. These allow some
    very powerful things to be done from the command line
